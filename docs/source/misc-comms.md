# Communication

We use various modes of communication in Echospace to keep ourselves up-to-date on what we are each working on and coordinate.

Depending on who's involved and the context, we use different methods to communicate. In general:
- Internal (among group members): mostly Slack
- External (with colleagues outside of the group): emails
- GitHub: PR and issues, see [here](./compute-git.md) for how to get started
- Talking: we do talk in analog form!

In terms of expectations:
- We encourage proactive and frequent communication; for most projects we meet at least weekly to keep each other updated and set short and long term goals
- Immediate response are not expected unless urgent
- People may send messages/emails at their convenient time; aim to respond within a reasonable time frame
- Phone/text: usually reserved for urgent communication or offsite coordination
- Ask us/everyone for help, and provide help if you can!
