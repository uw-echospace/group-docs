# Code of Conduct

Echospace is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of group members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any group venue, including meetings, presentations, or discussions.


## Why
- Respect and take advantage of the diversity of background and expertise in this room
- Create an optimal learning and research environment for **everyone**


## How

We periodically discuss within the group about what we could do to make a good environment together. See [this page on our group website](https://uw-echospace.github.io/values/2023-10-coc-values/) for the latest discussion results.


## Reporting forms
- Provide feedback on what to improve either in person or use the [Echospace Anonymous Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/NZFZBQLk9BoMLZCV6) if you prefer to remain anonymous
- If you see something inappropriate, let Wu-Jung, Valentina, or Emilio know immediately, or contact the [Office of the Ombud](https://www.washington.edu/ombud/) for support in conflict resolution. You can refer to some additional resources from the UW HR office [here](https://hr.uw.edu/policies/complaint-resolution/) or refer to your department for advice.
