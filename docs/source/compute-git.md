# Git and GitHub

Here are some of the links we have compiled that have helped us understand how to use git and GitHub for our collaboration.
For readability, we will add a couple links for each topic we wish to guide you through.

## 1. Starting with git/GitHub
Git is a version control tool that provides a system where users can manage and develop multiple versions of their personal or professional projects.
* This [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/) introduces Git and GitHub's purpose and benefits very well.
* This [tutorial](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) explains the differences between git and GitHub and walks its readers through all the basic steps to get started with GitHub.

## 2. Repositories
Git repositories are where users often store their projects for contribution with their collaborators.
* The first place we recommend is the GitHub group's [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories) of repository management.
* Here is a great [guide](https://github.blog/2023-08-04-a-checklist-and-guide-to-get-your-repository-collaboration-ready/#get-started) for understanding the resposibilities for maintaining a repository.

There are many things you can do with a GitHub repository. The 2 major actions would be to fork the repository or clone it.
We recommend following this [link](https://www.theserverside.com/answer/Git-fork-vs-clone-Whats-the-difference) to understand the difference between these two actions.
### Forks
* This workflow [tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow#:~:text=The%20main%20advantage%20of%20the,push%20to%20the%20official%20repository.) provides a great explanation for git forks and where they stand in the entire workflow when contributing to a project.

### Clones
* This workflow [tutorial](https://www.warp.dev/terminus/git-clone-ssh) will be useful when beginning to clone git repositories to understand the differences between using HTTPS and SSH and how we set up SSH for cloning.

## 3. Branches
Git branches can be created by users to work on project features with assurance that any changes made in the branch will not affect the main repository.
* This is a great [breakdown](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) of how branches can be created and how they differ from the main/master of git repositories.
* We also recommend using the GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches#) to understand more on branches.

## 4. Updating your repository
After gaining a basic understanding of the topics covered above, you are prepared to start making changes to your GitHub repository.
The process typically consists of committing changes and creating pull requests to merge changed branches.
### Commits
* Here is a great [guide](https://github.blog/2022-06-30-write-better-commits-build-better-projects/) for understanding what makes a good git commit. It goes over what the messages should look like and when to make each commit.

### Pull requests
* Here is a great [guide](https://nira.com/github-pull-request/) for understanding what pull requests are and why they are used to merge branches when working in group projects. 

## 5. Miscellaneous
* Here are [some](https://dev.to/ruppysuppy/advanced-git-concepts-you-should-know-nle) advanced git/GitHub topics that one wouldn't **need** to know to start but will help as you get more familiar.
* Here is a full comprehensive [guide](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-git-and-github/) to cover any topics we may have missed.

## Final comment
Learning to use git/GitHub from scratch can be confusing since there are so many places to start from. Because of this, we recommend to prioritize what you need to know for your specific project tasks and start from there. We wish you all the best in your journey to mastering git!
